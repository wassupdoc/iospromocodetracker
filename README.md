## 📋 Setup Guide

### Quick Start (Recommended)
1. Open the [template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tkYNCup-ZtKozkpF6s96E__1DcsUUtso0afIQbF-poE/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Make a copy: **File → Make a copy**
3. Skip to step 3 of the Initial Setup below

### Manual Setup
Create a sheet with these columns:

### 2. Add the Script
